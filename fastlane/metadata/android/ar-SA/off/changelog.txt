* Application of food products is now a more global movement than ever. 500k products freed, 10K registered contributors, 182 countries. Will you join us ?
==================
What's new ?
==================
1. You get the 360 picture: nutrition, ingredients, and all food facts, neatly and clearly presented.
2. Get the "NutriScore" nutrition grade for all products in the world. Easily compare products. Easier than deciphering nutrition tables.
3. Get extra information from Wikipedia. Click on a food category, an additiveâ€¦ to learn more and see similar products.
4. You can set allergens alerts (always double check the actual label yourself though!)
5. You now get a scan history you can export and that never leaves your phone
6. You can shake your phone at any time in the app to start scanning
7. You can now add new products even when you're offline
8. You can now help complete your favorite foods directly from the app: take photos, fill info, make food transparency happen
9. Everything is also much faster. Products load blazingly fast, even with a bad mobile connection.
10. We're still not interested in your personal data. You don't have to sign-up to scan and contribute.
Extra! Despite all the new stuff, the app is as light as before. The space left on your phone is sacred.
